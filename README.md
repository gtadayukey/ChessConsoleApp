## Features
  
- Two-Player Gameplay: Players can engage in a game of chess against each other.
- Complete Rules Implementation: The app enforces all constraints and special moves of chess: **Promotion, Castling** and **En Passant**, providing an authentic gaming experience.
- Object-Oriented Design: The project emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring clean, modular, and maintainable code.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Build the solution using your preferred C# development environment.
3. Run the application.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to start and play the game.

## Future Implementations

1. Web Interface Implementation
Introduce a web interface using Entity Framework and JavaScript to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the chess game. This web interface could replace or complement the existing console interface, providing users with a more interactive and visually engaging experience.

2. PGN Chess Code Reader
Develop a PGN (Portable Game Notation) reader to parse and interpret chess matches recorded in PGN format. This feature would allow users to replay historic games move by move, observing strategies and tactics employed by world-class players.

3. Database Integration
Integrate a database to store and retrieve famous chess matches, including those of legendary players such as Garry Kasparov, Bobby Fischer, Magnus Carlsen, and Hikaru Nakamura. This database could serve as a valuable resource for players to study and learn from historic games.

4. Basic AI Opponent
Implement a basic AI opponent to enable single-player gameplay. The AI would analyze the board state and make strategic decisions to provide a challenging gaming experience for solo players. Initially, the AI could employ simple algorithms such as minimax with alpha-beta pruning.

5. Online Multiplayer Support
Explore options to add online multiplayer functionality, allowing players to compete against friends or other enthusiasts over the internet. Implementing features such as matchmaking, chat, and leaderboards could further enhance the multiplayer experience.

6. Advanced AI Algorithms
For advanced users, implement more sophisticated AI algorithms, such as neural networks or reinforcement learning, to create a stronger and more dynamic opponent. These algorithms could adapt and improve over time, providing a challenging opponent for players of all skill levels.
